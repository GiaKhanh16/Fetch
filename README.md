### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

Please check out my super clean/beautiful caching system in the video demonstration here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMDJ56R-anY

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

- I prioritized writing a very clean, efficient, reliable networking/caching system. I wanted to focus on being very solid at the fundamentals of networking/caching and errors handling, not too much UI.
  
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

- I spent a lot of time refactoring, rewriting code, I wanted to make the code super clean and easy to use or debug. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

- I could've taken more time to do more research on writing swift testing, more testing code, more real world scenario for testing.
- I could've gotten more creative UI to interact with the API.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

- The weakest part problably is the lack of creative features for UI and testing.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

Future improvement: I would love to build more feature to show case the efficient and resillence of my caching, I would focus more on Swift Testing
